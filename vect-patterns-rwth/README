Advanced Vectorization Examples
===============================

This repository contains a number of examples that use advanced vectorization.
These are examples of programs that need some degree of trickery to work.
Each example consists of a README file, a Makefile and the source code.

* inner_loop_reduce
    showcases ways to resolve conflicts among lanes, where we have to reduce into a variable memory location.
* fill_lanes 
    transforms an inner loop in a vectorized algorithm in such a way that the body gets executed with as many lanes as possible.

Generally speaking, these examples will only work with an up-to-date Intel compiler.
Their effect is best shown on a Xeon Phi.
